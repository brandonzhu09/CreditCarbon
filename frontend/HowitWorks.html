      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The calculations involve converting <a href=" https://www.citibank.com/tts/solutions/commercial-cards/assets/docs/govt/Merchant-Category-Codes.pdf"> Merchant Category Codes (MCC)mcc</a>, which are categorical labels of any transaction that describes the kind of purchase made (e.g. MCC 2065 - Electrical Parts & Equipment, 5462 - Bakeries), to an associated carbon emissions value that are generated through evaluations of the machinery and technologies that were utilized to generate the product.</li>
        <li> We take the calculations and split the overall emissions calculation into four primary categories: Food, Shopping, Entertainment, and Transportation. Keep in mind that not all transactions will fall into these four categories, so the emissions values for the categories may not add up to the overall emissions value.</li>
