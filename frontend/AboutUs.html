      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are a team of four college students: Austin Shi, Shahryar Kiani, Brandon Zhu, and Mallika Gupta. </p>

        <li>A modern-day carbon footprint is likely to be larger than one perceives. With all of the carbon emissions that go into producing the products we buy and all of the purchases made related to food, shopping, and other categories, we wanted to create a product that expressed an estimate of one's carbon footprint based on their purchases. Increasing awareness for our effect on the world through our purchases opens up the opportunity to host a more sustainable approach to developing our lifestyles.</li>
